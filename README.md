# LaunchKit

A production-ready SaaS starter kit for indie founders and startups.

## What it solves
Building a SaaS from scratch takes weeks. LaunchKit gives you the foundation in minutes - auth, payments, admin panel, and a clean UI ready to customize.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma
- Deployment: Vercel + Railway

## Features(Planned)
- [ ] User authentication (signup/login)
- [ ] JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
- [ ] User dashboard
- [ ] Password reset
- [ ] Payment integration (Razorpay)
- [ ] Admin panel
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Responsive UI

## Why I'm building this
To help founders launch faster and focus on their unique value, not rebuilding auth for the 100th time.
